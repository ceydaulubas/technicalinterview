          <h3>About Me.. </h3>
          <p>
            I graduated from Yeditepe University International Business Administration and Trade in 2016.
            I was a social and hardworking student throughout the university.
            I did a lot of internships during the university period and took a lot of tasks in the management club for 2 years.
            I started my business life in the marketing department right after my graduation.
            After 2.5 years of brand management experience, I decided to shift my career to software as a result of my travel to Holland to improve my language and myself.
            After self-learning for a while, I enrolled in the Ironhack Amsterdam  Bootcamp. I started Ironhack Amsterdam Web Development Bootcamp in October 2020.
            During 9 super intensive teaching weeks, I learned deeply information about full-stack development and created

          </p>
          <p>
            During and after the Bootcamp, I realized that I was a person who struggles with difficulties for myself,
            who does not give up, and can learn easily. For this reason,
            I believe that I will step into good jobs thanks to my researches and my good communication within the group on this new road I started.‚ù§Ô∏è
