        <p >
          I graduated from Yeditepe University International Business Administration and Trade in 2016.
          I was a social and hardworking student throughout the university.
          I did a lot of internships during the university period and took a lot of tasks in the management club for 2 years.
          I started my business life in the marketing department right after my graduation.
          After 2.5 years of brand management experience, I decided to shift my career to software as a result of my travel to Holland to improve my language and myself.
          After self-learning for a while, I enrolled in the Ironhack Amsterdam  Bootcamp. I started Ironhack Amsterdam Web Development Bootcamp in October 2020.
          During 9 super intensive teaching weeks, I learned deeply information about full-stack development and created
            <Link to="/projects" ><buton> 3 different projects. ðŸŽ‰</buton></Link>
        </p>
        <p style={{ marginLeft: "5%" }}>
          During and after the Bootcamp, I realized that I was a person who struggles with difficulties for myself,
          who does not give up, and can learn easily. For this reason,
          I believe that I will step into good jobs thanks to my researches and my good communication within the group on this new road I started.
